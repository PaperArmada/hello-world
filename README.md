Getting introduced to GitHub

This is PaperArmada. I'm excited to get to learn more about coding.
I have some basic experience from playing around and a few university courses,
but am eager to develop some truly valuable skillsets to make tools for myself.
I'm a mechanical engineer with interest in 3d printing, drones, and augmented reality.
It's a beautiful space where physics and computing meet.
